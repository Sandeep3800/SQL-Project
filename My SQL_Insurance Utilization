	-- Findings : This stored procedure named `Blood_Matcher` is designed to identify potential donors and recipients based on specific blood types ('O-' and 'AB+') within a certain age range (20 to 40 years old). It retrieves the names, ages, blood types, and hospitals of potential donors and recipients from the Healthcare database. The condition checks for a match between the blood types and hospitals of donors and recipients, or if they are from different hospitals. Additionally, it filters recipient names matching the input provided in the procedure call using regular expression. Overall, this procedure aims to find potential matches for blood donation between donors and recipients meeting specific criteria of blood type, age, and hospital affiliation or non-affiliation.
